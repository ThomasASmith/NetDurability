# Calling script for analyses of PMI net durability data, via Markov model


### SET OPTIONS

# codeMissing indicates how intervals with missing data at the end are treated, Options are:
# 'DXX' code only destroyed or repurposed nets as Attrited
# 'DRX' also code removed nets as Attrited
# 'DRA' also code nets that were absent as Attrited.
# 'DXA' code absent as Attrited, removed as not Attrited .
codeMissing= 'DXA'

# HoleCutoff determines which nets count as damaged
# Nets with pHI <= HoleCutoff are scored as intact
HoleCutoff=20 # 20 for the reference simulation

# To differently code missing data on holes, set value of repairs_recoded to 'intact' or 'holed'
repairs_recoded = 'holed'

# For analysis of a specific net type, change required_net_type to another type in the vector of net types
net_types <- c("Dawaplus 2.0","DuraNet","Interceptor","NetProtect","Olyset","PermaNet 2.0","PermaNet 3.0")
required_net_type='All'

# Number of samples to draw from the posterior densities of MCMC runs
nsamples_posterior =1000 #set to at least 1000 for definitive runs (use smaller values for testing to reduce compute time)
